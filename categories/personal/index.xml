As a result of that, I have gained a larger amount of secure coding practices and knowledge about specific security vulnerabilities, and exactly what one should not do when coding a system that needs to be secure.
main points: it /should/ be HARD and OBVIOUS to create security defects in apps it should be easy to create secure apps moreso, devs should not NEED to think about security as much as they do part of that should be taken care of by the framework that they use specifically web frameworks as those handle user input the MOST out of all technologies problem: it is EASY and DIFFICULT TO SPOT if a security defect exists in an app WHY is it a PROBLEM?</description></item></channel></rss>
