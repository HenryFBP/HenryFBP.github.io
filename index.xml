As a result of that, I have gained a larger amount of secure coding practices and knowledge about specific security vulnerabilities, and exactly what one should not do when coding a system that needs to be secure.
main points: it /should/ be HARD and OBVIOUS to create security defects in apps it should be easy to create secure apps moreso, devs should not NEED to think about security as much as they do part of that should be taken care of by the framework that they use specifically web frameworks as those handle user input the MOST out of all technologies problem: it is EASY and DIFFICULT TO SPOT if a security defect exists in an app WHY is it a PROBLEM?</description></item><item><title>Analyzing document-based malware and reverse engineering it</title><link>/posts/2020-04-27-analyzing-document-based-malware-and-reverse-engineering-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-04-27-analyzing-document-based-malware-and-reverse-engineering-it/</guid><description>The course The course this post is based off of is Expert Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering by Abhinav Singh.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Vulnserver!</title><link>/posts/2020-04-07-exploiting-vulnserver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-04-07-exploiting-vulnserver/</guid><description>My work/code View my work/code for this blog post at:

The course As part of on-the-job training, I got the chance to take a really nice course on UDemy called &amp;lsquo;Ethical Hacking &amp;amp; Bug Hunting: Buffer Overflow For Beginners&amp;rsquo; by Eslam Medhat.
https://www.udemy.com/course/buffer-overflow-course-exploit-development/
It uses Kali and Windows VMs that communicate with eachother in order to perform DLL injection that leads to a reverse shell being opened.
As someone who has never exploited this vulnerability before, this course gave me an intimate look into exactly how these attacks occur and how to craft one from scratch, provided you have the binary of the exploitable program.</description></item><item><title>Markdown Syntax Guide</title><link>/posts/markdown-syntax/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/markdown-syntax/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Placeholder Text</title><link>/posts/placeholder-text/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/placeholder-text/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de pectora summo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emoji Support</title><link>/posts/emoji-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/emoji-support/</guid><description>&lt;p>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
